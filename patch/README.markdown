# L-13 Mission Patch

![L-13 Mission Patch](http://psas.github.io/Launch-13/patch/L13_patch.svg)


## Symbology:

 - "PSAS": [Portland State Aerospace Society](http://psas.github.io)
 - "L-13": [Launch 13](https://github.com/psas/Launch-13), the 14th flight for PSAS
 - "<sub>6</sub>C": Carbon 
 - Carbon fiber background: This will be our first 100% carbon fiber airframe based on a senior engineering capstone project in 2014 and two more in 2016 that designed a process for boulding extreemly lightwieght airframe sections.
 - Empty space: This is an airframe test, so there will be very little else on the flight, thus the patch is very simple.
